# Smart Farming using Supervised Learning based on IOT
The projects in this section are two different projects that I participated in 2 different university assignment through different scopes. 

Introduction to Project 1:

Automated Plant Watering System using Supervised learning 

a. OBJECTIVE
This project has been devised to incorporate the discipline of Supervised machine learning to the dataset values crucial to plant growth transmitted wirelessly to the system to obtain adequate results which can be further processed fed into an automated watering system. The objectives of the project include-
1. To develop a system that is capable of predicting the water level required for the healthy growth of a plant.
2. In order to detect this amount of water, the system should be capable of extracting target parameters such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture. 
3. The proposed system employs machine learning to facilitate the prediction of water level with the inputs being these target features. 
4. The system should be robust and efficient against different seasons faced by the plant and contribute towards water conservation.
5. The proposed system should be automated and consist of a watering system that makes it an independent product which leaves the user free of worry and with healthy plants. 

b. SCOPE

-Database collection for the three target parameters over a month.
-Wireless communication between the Node MCU and the machine learning algorithm.
-Prediction of output water level using multiple machine learning algorithms and their comparison.
-Implement automated plant watering system.

# Project Management Report for Smart Farming based on IOT and AI

Introduction to Project 2:

There is a real need for an integrated system to assist farmers in deciding whichcrop suits their condition, by leveraging environment and market data. The first part
of the system is to gather environment data by using the Internet of Things (IoT) devices, market data by using web crawlers/Application Programming Interface (API) and farmers' data via a mobile application. This data will be fed to cloud computing for storage and analysis. The second part of the system is to analyse which crop is suitable for each farmer using Artificial Intelligence (AI). The third part is making this information available to farmers through AquaSpy mobile application to help them make informed decisions.
The project approach of product development is Waterfall because a greater emphasis on planning and designing stage. However, as the first to introduce a
solution to market, we are exposed to a certain degree of uncertainty. To counter this, we involve our potential customers in market research and Agronomist through
several iterations.
